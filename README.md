# Endangered Species in National Parks: Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is an in-depth analysis of data from the National Parks Service concerning endangered species across various national parks. Our primary focus is to explore and identify patterns and themes in the conservation statuses of these species, shedding light on the critical issue of wildlife endangerment.

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Thoroughly clean and organize the dataset to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Analytical Exploration:** Conduct comprehensive data analysis to understand the conservation statuses of species across different parks.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Investigate potential trends in the types of species that are becoming endangered.
- **Insightful Visualizations:** Create compelling visual representations of our findings to communicate the results effectively.

## Questions to Explore
1. What is the distribution of conservation statuses for species in various national parks?
2. Are certain types of species more prone to endangerment?
3. Do specific parks have a higher incidence of endangered species?
4. How do the numbers of endangered species vary across different taxonomic groups?

## Methodology
- Utilizing Python and its libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data manipulation and visualization.
- Applying statistical analysis to understand the distribution and correlation among different variables.
- Interpreting results to draw meaningful conclusions and insights about wildlife conservation.

## Data Source
The dataset for this project is sourced from the National Parks Service, providing detailed information on species across several national parks, their conservation statuses, and other relevant biological classifications (Codecademy).
